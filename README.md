"This is a recreation of the realm door from the moive "Monsters, inc." with fully functional LEDs controlled from a web app, hosted from a closed access point server. The design and project creation was from a good freind of mine, who is not only an extremely talented front end developer, but also has the ability to create crafts with perfection. He asked me for extended help since there was a tight delivery schedule and was getting into the uncharted territories. So, With use of Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D printer, ESP32-S2 mini's, ESPNOW communication, micropython programming, Neopixel LED rings and strip, many design versions later, and a basic web app to control the lights, we finally had ourselves a sweet looking replica."
