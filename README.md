"This is a recreation of the realm door from the moive "Monsters, inc." with fully functional LEDs controlled from a web app, hosted from a closed access point server. The design and project creation was from a good freind of mine, who is not only an extremely talented front end developer, but also has the ability to create crafts with perfection. He asked me for extended help since there was a tight delivery schedule and was getting into the uncharted territories. So, With use of Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D printer, ESP32-S2 mini's, ESPNOW communication, micropython programming, Neopixel LED rings and strip, many design versions later, and a basic web app to control the lights, we finally had ourselves a sweet looking replica.  

Not knowing the Battery life expectancy, we decided to do a full run. I had estimated 2.5 hours at full power consumption. The batteries are rechargable 9V 1300mAh from amazon. to much supprise and after some code change to limit only call on demand, the batteries held up for 5 hours! Not bad for running 3 ESP32-S2 mini controllers, a access point server network at full time, and 56 WS2812B LEDs."
